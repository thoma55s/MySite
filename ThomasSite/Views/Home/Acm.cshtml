<h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
<p>As Vice President of ACM, I charge of leading the practice sessions for the ICPC</p>
<p>
    We primarily use <u><a href="https://open.kattis.com/">Kattis</a></u> for finding practice problems.
    We deal primarily with time complexity problems and work to reduce the time complexity of our solutions to
    match the criteria Kattis provides.
</p>
<p>
    I also am IUS's Computer Security Group's Events Cooridnator. 
    I work with ACM's and IUS's Women in Computing Event's Coordinators to help plan events 
    and meetups such as game night's and learning sessions.
